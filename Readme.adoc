= Project Loom: Fibers and Continuations

Repository with the examples presented in the link:https://www.meetup.com/jvm-mx/[JVM Mexico Meetup]

The slides of the talk are available in link:https://speakerdeck.com/mrpato/project-loom-fibers-and-continuations[Speaker Deck]

The purpose of this repository is to show with 3 simple classes the behavior and how  to start in exploring the current state of the API for lightweight concurrency with Java. 

The examples are the following: 

* link:src/dev/aguacate/labs/fibers/demo/ContinuationsDemo.java[ContinuationsDemo]: Shows with a simple example how to use a `Continuation`, yield and resume it execution. 
* link:src/dev/aguacate/labs/fibers/demo/FibersDemo.java[FibersDemo]: Starts a million fibers in order to show how simple is to create and schedule them. 
* link:src/dev/aguacate/labs/fibers/demo/SecondFibersDemo.java[SecondFibersDemo]: Its intention is to show `deadlines`, `cancel-propagation` and `nesting` of `FiberScopes`, also shows a practical case of how a `Fiber` wraps a task into a `Continuation`. 

== What do I need?

These examples needs a special early access `OpenJdk (version: 14)` and a previous installed version of link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA]: 

1. Download the `jdk-14` from link:https://jdk.java.net/loom/[] select the one that fits your operating system. 

2. Just decompress it in a folder of your selection. 

3. Once installed the `jdk` is necessary to add the version to `IntelliJ IDEA`. To configure simply follow this link:https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/getting_started/setting_up_environment.html[instructions]

Once the installation and configuration of the `jdk` is ready everything is ready to be run with `IntelliJ IDEA`.
